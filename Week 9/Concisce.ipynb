We did not have to individually allocate parameters, define our loss function, or implement minibatch stochastic gradient descent. Once we start working with much more complex models, advantages of high-level APIs will grow considerably. However, once we have all the basic pieces in place, the training loop itself is strikingly similar to what we did when implementing everything from scratch."],"metadata":{"id":"I6ACrA8JVt6i"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["num_epochs = 3\n","for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n","    for X, y in data_iter:\n","        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n","            l = loss(net(X, training=True), y)\n","        grads = tape.gradient(l, net.trainable_variables)\n","        trainer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, net.trainable_variables))\n","    l = loss(net(features), labels)\n","    print(f'epoch {epoch + 1}, loss {l:f}')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sH52YwHxVxFg","outputId":"d5b230ba-3db4-436d-c380-5fc9b801273c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1656154162639,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":1112,"user":{"displayName":"Full Garage / Taqiy Dzaki M","userId":"02502763380952810123"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["epoch 1, loss 0.000280\n","epoch 2, loss 0.000100\n","epoch 3, loss 0.000100\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["w = net.get_weights()[0]\n","print('error in estimating w', true_w - tf.reshape(w, true_w.shape))\n","b = net.get_weights()[1]\n","print('error in estimating b', true_b - b)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GG5f1OyOV2KQ","outputId":"477f40d0-0ecf-4609-c593-4ceae724698f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1656154162641,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Full Garage / Taqiy Dzaki M","userId":"02502763380952810123"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["error in estimating w tf.Tensor([-0.00122023  0.00021625], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)\n","error in estimating b [0.00046062]\n"]}]}]}
